## 📊 Project 1: SQL Walmart Sales Analysis  
🔗 [Project SQL File](https://github.com/Sourabh22C/Sql_walmart/blob/main/Project.sql)

### 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The main goal of this project is to gain insight into the sales data of Walmart to understand various factors that impact the sales performance of different branches.

### 📂 About the Data  
The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).  
It contains transactional data from three Walmart branches located in **Mandalay**, **Yangon**, and **Naypyitaw**. The dataset has **17 columns** and **1000 rows**.
